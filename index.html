    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <section id="about" aria-labelledby="about-title">
  <h2 id="about-title">My Backgroud</h2>

  <p><strong>I’m Victor Kublanov</strong> — a Strategic Business Analyst, Consultant, and Mentor with over 13 years of experience in IT and management.</p>

  <p>Throughout my career, I’ve worked at the intersection of <strong>business needs</strong> and <strong>technology solutions</strong>, helping companies transform their operations, align their teams, and deliver results that matter. 
  My expertise spans <em>business analysis</em>, <em>product management</em>, <em>delivery leadership</em>, and <em>solution design</em>, giving me a <strong>T-shaped perspective</strong> that connects vision with execution.</p>

  <p>What defines my approach is a <strong>growth mindset</strong> and <strong>clarity of structure</strong>. 
  I believe management is not only about processes and tools, but also about people — their motivation, communication, and capacity to grow. 
  By combining emotional intelligence, active listening, and strategic frameworks, I help teams and leaders uncover their unique path forward.</p>

  <h3>What I Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consulting for IT Managers & Businesses</strong> — I provide tailored strategies to solve complex challenges: from building roadmaps to optimizing delivery pipelines and scaling teams.</li>
    <li><strong>Mentoring Future Leaders</strong> — I mentor business analysts, managers, and IT switchers, guiding them to develop clarity, confidence, and leadership skills. My structured mentoring sessions often result in clear roadmaps for professional growth.</li>
    <li><strong>Content & Thought Leadership</strong> — I share insights through <em>podcasts</em> (<strong>Думки Менеджера</strong>), <em>livestreams</em> (<strong>33,3 хвилини для росту</strong>), and short-form content across LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. These platforms are where I explore leadership, management, and self-development in the age of digital transformation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>My Vision</h3>
  <p>We live in a time of the <strong>4th Industrial Revolution</strong>, where industries, teams, and careers are constantly reshaped by technology. 
  In this fast-changing world, leaders need more than just tools — they need the ability to observe, reflect, and guide others with clarity.</p>

  <p>My mission is to help managers and businesses grow with balance — combining strategic vision with human connection. 
  I believe every challenge hides an opportunity for transformation if approached with the right questions, not just the right answers.</p>

  <h3>Let’s Connect</h3>
  <p>If you are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An IT manager facing complex challenges in projects or team growth,</li>
    <li>A business analyst or product professional looking for guidance in your career,</li>
    <li>A leader or entrepreneur seeking clarity in strategy and communication,</li>
  </ul>
  <p>…I’d be glad to connect, share insights, and explore how we can grow together.</p>
